# Quick Reference: Project Hours Summary

> **Note:** This is a quick reference. See [PROJECT-HOURS-ANALYSIS.md](PROJECT-HOURS-ANALYSIS.md) for detailed analysis.

## 🎯 Closest to 350 Hours

| Project | Hours | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| **C** - Education Platform | 320-330 | ✅ Well-scoped | Content creation is less AI-acceleratable |
| **E** - PR Readiness Dashboard | 350 | ✅ Well-scoped | Good timeline breakdown |
| **E-Ext** - Security Triage | 350 | ✅ Well-scoped | Builds on Project E |
| **G** - NetGuardian | 330 | ✅ Well-scoped | Security domain needs expertise |
| **H** - BLT Growth | 350 | ✅ Well-scoped | Sizzle-first approach is clear |

## ⚡ May Be Faster with AI (250-320 hours)

| Project | Estimated with AI | Status | Recommendation |
|---------|------------------|--------|----------------|
| **K** - Frontend Migration | 250-280 | ⚠️ Fast with AI | Add stretch goals or deeper testing |
| **J** - News API | 280-320 | ⚠️ Fast with AI | Consider adding advanced features |

## ⚠️ Need Scope Clarification

| Project | Issue | Recommendation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **A** - CVE Pipeline | No timeline | Add detailed phase breakdown |
| **B** - Gamification | Unclear if includes "light C" | Clarify scope, may be 400+ hours with light C |
| **D** - Knowledge Sharing | Too short (200-250h) | Combine with Project C or expand scope |

## 🔴 May Need Scope Reduction

| Project | Estimated Hours | Status | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| **F** - Reputation Graph | 400-500 | ⚠️ Too ambitious | Focus on core engine, defer standalone app |
| **I** - Onboarding | 400-450 | ⚠️ Too ambitious | Simplify AI guide, focus on key pages |

## AI Acceleration Impact

### 🚀 High Impact (50-70% faster)
- UI/Dashboard development
- API endpoint creation
- TypeScript/component migration
- Data pipeline setup

**Projects:** K, J, E, H

### ⚙️ Medium Impact (30-50% faster)
- Infrastructure code
- Integration logic
- Basic CRUD operations

**Projects:** C, E-Ext, I

### 🎓 Low Impact (10-30% faster)
- Security algorithm design
- Educational content creation
- Anti-gaming logic
- Domain-specific validation

**Projects:** A, B, F, G

## Key Takeaway

> "Some projects can be done with one prompt in four hours" - While this is an exaggeration, **AI coding significantly accelerates UI/API-heavy projects** (K, J, E, H) but has limited impact on projects requiring **security expertise and domain knowledge** (A, F, G).

Projects C, E, G, and H are **best calibrated** for 350 hours considering AI assistance.
