# Project Ideas — Brief Overview

A short reference of BLT GSoC project options. 

---

## Purpose

Synthesizes community direction (Discussion #5495). Each standalone project fits one 350-hour slot. 

---

### Project A — CVE Detection & Validation Pipeline

**One line:** Opt-in pipeline from scanner/GitHub → NVD validation → GHSC model and verification UI/API.

**Description:** Discovers CVE-related contributions from webhooks and scanner output (e.g. Buttercup), validates against NVD, deduplicates and scores findings, and exposes them via a maintainer verification dashboard and REST API. Post-disclosure only; no raw exploit storage. Foundation for downstream rewards and education.

---

### Project B — Security Contribution Gamification & Recognition

**One line:** Consume verified security contributions to award BACON/badges, reputation tiers, leaderboards, and challenges.

**Description:** Listens for verified GHSC (or equivalent) events and awards rewards idempotently: BACON, badges, reputation tiers (Beginner → Trusted), severity-weighted leaderboards, and security challenges. Includes admin audit and basic fraud controls. Does not do detection or NVD; assumes a feed of verified contributions (real or mocked).

**Add-on (optional): light C (education bridge)**  
Project B can be extended with a **light C** add-on in the same 350-hour slot. Light C is *not* a separate project: it adds read-only APIs and an optional webhook that expose badge/reputation and leaderboard data (no raw CVE or vulnerability details). Future education platforms can use these to unlock courses or show contributor standing. No labs, no curriculum — just the APIs so B’s outputs can drive education tooling. The **recommended** proposal is **B + light C** as one project.

---

### Project C — blt-education Platform (standalone)

**One line:** Tiered learning tracks, hands-on labs, auto-quizzes, and instructor review workflows.

**Description:** Structured security education: Beginner → Intermediate → Trusted tracks, 4–6 labs, auto-grading, instructor review queue, and optional badge-based unlocks. High content and mentoring load; best when education/content capacity exists.

---

### Project D — Knowledge Sharing & Community Impact (standalone)

**One line:** Anonymized aggregation, public dashboards, reports, and remediation playbooks.

**Description:** Pipeline to anonymize and aggregate BLT security data, then publish dashboards, monthly/quarterly reports, and 3–5 remediation playbooks. Includes two-person approval for sensitive content. Depends on having meaningful data to aggregate.

---

### Project E — PR Readiness Tracker & Contributor Dashboard

**One line:** Web-based PR readiness checker with CI aggregation, discussion analysis, reviewer intent detection, and a contributor-facing dashboard.

**Description:** A single 350-hour project that answers “when is this PR actually ready?” in one place. **CI aggregation** combines all GitHub check runs and commit statuses into one pass/fail/pending state. **Discussion analysis** classifies review comments (e.g. actionable vs non-actionable vs resolved) and tracks thread resolution so contributors know what still needs a response. **Reviewer intent detection** distinguishes blocking feedback from suggestions and nitpicks (with support for common bots like CodeRabbit, Cursor, etc.). Contributors drop PRs into a **web dashboard** to track readiness across multiple PRs, re-check after addressing feedback, and get a clear status (e.g. READY, ACTION_REQUIRED, CI_FAILING). Aligns with GSoC goals around contributor tooling and AI-assisted workflows; can integrate with BLT’s GitHub workflows and optionally feed into verification pipelines (e.g. Project A) later. Inspired by the [Good To Go](https://dsifry.github.io/goodtogo/) approach (deterministic PR readiness) but adds a BLT-hosted web UI and deeper discussion/reviewer-intent analysis.

#### Project E (Extension) — AI-Assisted Security Remediation Triage

**One line:**  
Advisory security triage for PRs that flags risky patterns and surfaces explainable remediation guidance via GitHub and a BLT dashboard.

**Description:** 
Extends Project E with a security-focused triage layer that analyzes PR diffs, CI results, and review context to identify potential security hardening issues (e.g., unsafe TLS configuration, token handling, CI/CD injection risks). Findings are *advisory only* and exposed as GitHub check annotations/comments and a BLT-hosted web view. No exploit storage, no automated blocking, and no CVE detection.

**Scope-notes:**  
- Deterministic rules first; optional ML assistance for prioritization  
- Human-in-the-loop review to reduce false positives  
- Builds directly on Project E’s CI aggregation and discussion analysis  
- Optional future integration with Project A is out of scope

## Differentiation (standalone options)

| Project | Focus | Beneficiaries | Dependencies | Risk level |
|---------|--------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| A | Detection + validation | Maintainers, contributors | NVD, scanning | High (false positives) |
| B | Rewards + recognition | Active contributors | Verified signals (or mocks) | Medium (gaming, economics) |
| C | Education platform | New contributors | Content, mentoring | Medium (content burden) |
| D | Knowledge sharing | OSS ecosystem | Aggregated data, governance | Medium (privacy) |
| E | PR readiness & workflow | Contributors, maintainers | GitHub API, (optional) BLT auth | Medium (API limits, parsers) |

---

## Decision guide

Choose by primary goal (one project per slot):

- **Rewards & recognition for verified security work** (BACON, badges, leaderboards, education bridge) → **Project B + light C**
- **CVE detection & verification pipeline** (GHSC, NVD, maintainer verification UI/API) → **Project A**
- **PR readiness & merge workflow** (CI aggregation, discussion analysis, reviewer intent, web dashboard) → **Project E**
- **Structured education & knowledge sharing** (labs, playbooks, dashboards, approval workflow) → **Project C + D** (combined into one 350h project)

---

## Cross-cutting notes

- **Decoupling B from A:** B is designed around a generic “verified security contribution” event; it does not require Project A. Fixtures or a small admin UI can supply events during GSoC; A→B integration is optional later.
- **A + B in one 350-hour slot:** Not recommended; both need focused scope, testing, and pilot time. Treat as two separate projects.
- **C + D combined:** One 350-hour project is possible: education platform (tracks, labs, quizzes, review) plus knowledge-sharing (anonymization, dashboards, playbooks, approval workflow). Shares data and governance concerns.
- **Project E and A:** E (PR readiness) is independent. Optionally, “PR ready” from E could later feed into A’s pipeline (e.g. only consider PRs for GHSC once readiness is READY or after manual triage), but that integration is out of scope for a single 350h slot.
